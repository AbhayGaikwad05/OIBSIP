# üõ°Ô∏è Network Security Threats Report:

*Author:* Abhay R. Gaikwad
*Task:* Research on Common Network Security Threats.
*Date:* July 2025.
*Internship Requirement:* ‚úÖ Completed

---

## üéØ Objective:

This report provides a brief overview of three major network security threats: **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**, **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and **Spoofing**, with their impacts,
 real-world examples, and prevention techniques.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:

*Description:* Overloads a target system or network with traffic, making it slow or unavailable. 
*Example:* In 2018, GitHub was hit by a 1.35 Tbps DoS attack using vulnerable memcached servers. 
*Impact:* Service disruption, financial losses, damage to reputation. 
*Prevention:* Rate limiting, firewalls, load balancers, DDoS protection (Cloudflare, AWS Shield).

---

## üë• 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:

*Description:* An attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters data between two parties. 
*Example:* Lenovo‚Äôs Superfish (2015) used fake SSL certificates to intercept HTTPS traffic. 
*Impact:* Credential theft, data tampering, privacy breaches. 
*Prevention:* Enforce HTTPS/TLS, use VPNs, implement SSL pinning.

---

## üïµÔ∏è 3. Spoofing Attacks:

*Description:* Attacker pretends to be a trusted device or user by faking IP, DNS, ARP, or email identities. 
*Example:* The Kaminsky DNS attack (2008) redirected users to malicious sites using forged DNS responses. 
*Impact:* Unauthorized access, phishing, data leaks. 
*Prevention:* DNSSEC, ARP inspection, SPF/DKIM/DMARC for emails.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table:

| Threat   | Description                    | Key Prevention              |
|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| DoS      | Traffic flooding               | Firewalls, DDoS protection  |
| MITM     | Communication interception     | Encryption, VPN             |
| Spoofing | Identity forgery               | DNSSEC, Email auth tools    |
